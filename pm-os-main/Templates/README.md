# PRD Format Library

7 document formats for product work, matched to your situation. Each format serves a different stage, audience, and level of detail.

**How this works:** When you use `/prd`, the AI asks 2-3 diagnostic questions (stage, audience, detail level), matches your answers to the metadata tags on each format, and presents 1-2 matching formats. You pick the one that fits, and the AI generates your PRD using that structure plus your Context/ files.

## Metadata Reference

Each format file has metadata tags at the top, following the same pattern as `Knowledge/Prioritization/`. The AI uses these tags to route you to the right format.

- `Discovery` — still understanding the problem
- `Validation` — testing whether assumptions hold
- `Shaping` — defining scope and boundaries
- `Planning` — getting buy-in for what to build

- `New Product` — 0-to-1 initiative
- `Feature Work` — incremental to existing product
- `Quick Alignment` — need to align fast, async
- `Exec Buy-In` — need leadership approval

**Best For:**
- `Problem Framing` — defining what to solve
- `Hypothesis Testing` — validating assumptions
- `Scope Definition` — drawing boundaries
- `Stakeholder Alignment` — getting everyone on same page
- `Eng Handoff` — everything engineering needs to build
- `Exec Approval` — getting a go/no-go decision
